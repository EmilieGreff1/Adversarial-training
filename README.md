# Facial Identification Model with Adversarial Training on LFW Dataset

This project implements a facial identification model using deep learning techniques and adversarial training on the Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset. The goal of this project is to accurately identify faces in images with adversarial training, which enhances the model's ability to handle variations in lighting, pose, and other factors that can affect facial recognition.

## Dataset
The LFW dataset contains over 13,000 images of faces collected from the internet, with over 5,700 unique individuals. The dataset is split into training and testing sets, with approximately 70% of the images used for training and 30% for testing. The dataset includes annotations indicating the identity of each individual in the images.

## Model Architecture
The model architecture used for this project is based on the ResNet-50 architecture, which is a deep neural network that has been successfully applied to a wide range of computer vision tasks, including facial recognition. The model is trained using adversarial training, which involves adding perturbations to the input images to improve the model's robustness to variations in the data.

## Dependencies
The following dependencies are required to run the code:

* Python 3.6 or higher
* TensorFlow 2.0 or higher
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
